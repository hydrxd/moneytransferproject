# Reward Module Implementation

Your task is to design and implement a reward module that sits on top of this system and incentivizes users for eligible transactions while maintaining the history of rewards granted to the user.

The goal of this module is to:
- Encourage usage through rewards
- Apply clear, rule-based reward logic
- Maintain transparency and traceability of rewards

## Reward Eligibility Rules

A transaction is eligible for rewards only if all of the following conditions are met:
1. Transaction status is SUCCESS
2. Transaction amount is greater than 100
3. Sender and receiver are different users
4. Transaction is not self-transfer

## Reward Calculation Logic

For every eligible transaction:
- 1 reward point per 100 transferred
- Points are rounded down
- Example:
  - 250 → 2 points
  - 99 → 0 points (not eligible anyway)
